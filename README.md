### **The Algorithm Explained**

1. **Feature Engineering**: Combines title, genres, overview, and keywords into a unified text corpus
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the angular distance between movie vectors (0 to 1 scale)
4. **Ranking**: Sorts movies by similarity score and returns top recommendations
5. **User Interface**: Presents results with rich metadata and intuitive controls
